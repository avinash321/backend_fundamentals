backend fundamentals:
- MAC Address: A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a hardware-level
 unique identifier assigned to a network interface (NIC),
 not to the whole device.
One laptop with: Wi-Fi, Ethernet
will have 2 MAC addresses.

- IP Address: An IP address is assigned to a device when it connects 
to a network (not necessarily the internet).
It can be assigned by:
DHCP (dynamic)
Manually configured (static)
Even a local LAN without internet gives IPs.

- ARP Protocol: A protocol that maps IP address → MAC address 
inside a local network.
Example:
“Who has IP 192.168.1.10? Tell me your MAC.”

- ICMP Protocol : Internet Control Message Protocol
ICMP is used for:
Error reporting, Network reachability, Diagnostics
Used by:ping, traceroute

- traceroute : The path (routers) a packet takes to reach a destination.

- tcpdump: A packet sniffer that captures live network traffic.
